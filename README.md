# Experiment---5

1. WAP to read a list of integers and store it in a single dimensional array. Write a C
program to print the second largest integer in a list of integers.

2. WAP to read a list of integers and store it in a single dimensional array. Write a C
program to count and display positive, negative, odd, and even numbers in an array.

3. WAP to read a list of integers and store it in a single dimensional array. Write a C
program to find the frequency of a particular number in a list of integers.

4. WAP that reads two matrices A (m x n) and B (p x q) and computes the product A
and B. Read matrix A and matrix B in row major order respectively. Print both the
input matrices and resultant matrix with suitable headings and output should be in
matrix format only. Program must check the compatibility of orders of the matrices
for multiplication. Report appropriate message in case of incompatibility.
